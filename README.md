## Game Rules 🎮 

Gobblet is played on a 4x4 board, and each player has 12 pieces of varying sizes. The goal is to line up four of your pieces in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The rules are simple:
1. On your turn, you can either place a new piece on the board or move an existing piece to an empty spot.
2. A larger piece can cover a smaller one, and players can move pieces to uncover their own or their opponent's pieces.
